# Kubeforward (WIP)

A CLI tool which helps you to expose easily a pod to your local machine without having to use the kubectl command

# Usage

```shell
# default
kubeforward

# with a different context
kubeforward -c

# with a different namespace
kubeforward -n

# we can combine both such as
kubeforward -c -n
```
